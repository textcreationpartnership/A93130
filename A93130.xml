            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:119794:3"/>be in many reſpects; neither can the Anſwers to ſo many ſtrange, ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and unheard of queſtions, being conceiv'd on a ſudden, by way of anſwer to a Letter, be expected to be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory and full, as to all particulars: Longer time for further and more mature deliberation, might in ſome good meaſure have ſupplyed many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects; but that I was unwilling to add any thing to what was diſpatcht away by way of anſwer to the <hi>Letter</hi> (or rather <hi>Libell</hi>) of the ſcrupulous <hi>Queſtioner,</hi> that ſo both might appear to the eye of the world <hi>verbatim,</hi> without addition or diminution.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:119794:4"/>become vain in their imaginations, to be of this, or that, or what opinion they pleaſe in Religion: As alſo to perform the publick parts of divine worſhip, according to the ſeverall dictates of their owne mindes, even in any way, but what is decent, reverend, uniform and orderly: Since ſuch (I ſay) is the ſad and confuſed condition of our Church, it is no marvail though there daily ariſe new Sects, and new Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; ſuch which are not onely ſtrange, wilde, and fanatick, but even deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to the very being of true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity: Nor muſt we hope for other, till the God of all truth and peace be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, together with his truth, to reſtore unity and order in his worſhip; whereof for our manifold ſins he hath ſo long deprived us.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>48</label> By the two firſt of theſe qualities, 'twill be a hard matter to diſtinguiſh a falſe ſpirit from the Spirit of truth: For as it is ordinary and common to every wind, to be both ſudden and vehement; ſo 'tis common to every ſpirit alſo, both true and falſe; nay, commonly falſe and faigned ſpirits are more violent and vehement, and make a greater noyſe and ſtir in the world
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:119794:76"/>then the true Spirit doth; and there is good reaſon for it: for the falſe ſpirit wanting the native ſtrength and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine efficacy of the truth to ſupport it, flyes therefore to force and violence, earneſt zeal and forwardneſſe to bear up in the mindes and good opinions of the world.</p>
                  <p>For the tryal of ſpirits then, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this rule, we muſt look upon the two other properties of this divine divine wind, which are not ordinary, and common, and not naturall to that wind which blows in the ayr.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, <hi>it came from heaven]</hi> Winds do not naturally come from heaven, but out of the caves and hollows of the earth, or out of the middle region of the ayr; neither do they blow <hi>deſurſum,</hi> downwards, as this wind did, but la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally, from one coaſt or climate to another; but this wind came di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly downwards, and <hi>de coelo,</hi> from heaven it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, it <hi>filled the houſe</hi> where they were ſitting, and no houſe but that: The wind naturally blows upon all places alike, within its circuit; but this wind blew electively as it were,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:119794:77"/>and by diſcretion, making choyce of one place onely to blow upon, and no other; ſo that in both theſe reſpects it is manifeſt it was a wind extraordinary, and ſupernaturall.</p>
                  <p>And by theſe two properties we may try and examine, both the truth of our owne, and of the ſpirits of others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> If firſt, thoſe deſires, opinions, and actions which relate to Religion, be from above, if the ground thereof be fetcht <hi>de coelo,</hi> from heaven; ſo that they tend to make us heavenly minded, to wean our hearts from the world, to elevate and raiſe up our affections to things above, to form and frame our converſations towards heaven:
<note place="margin">Col. 3.2.</note>
                  </p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> If ſecondly, they keep us within the pale and limits of the Church, if they tend to the general benefit, edification, profit, and good of the houſhold of faith; and to the conſervation of peace, and love, and unity amongſt Chriſtians, we may then be cofident it is the heavenly wind, the divine breath of the Almighty, the holy Spirit of God that inſpires them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> But if otherwiſe theſe motions and opinions that ſeem religious, be either firſt grounded upon earthly and worldly
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:119794:77"/>reſpects, have the private aims and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, either of ambition, vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory, and popular applauſe, as in ſome, or of worldly profit, benefit, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, as in others; or of hatred, malice, revenge, as in a third ſort of men: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Or if ſecondly they tend to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, ſchiſme, ſeparation, debate, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance, malice, hatred, envy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If either they ſmell rank of the world, or taſte of any fruits of the fleſh, recorded, Gal. 5.19. <hi>Now the works of the fleſh are manifeſt, which are theſe, adultery, fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> &amp;c. Then this wind ſurely comes not from heaven, there is nothing in it but what is either naturall, or worſe; ſuggeſted by the ſpirit of error: 'Tis ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a revelation of fleſh and blood, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing out of the caves and hollows of an earthly minde; or elſe it is inſpired and blown from thoſe regions of the air which are the habitation of unclean ſpirits: 'Tis not <hi>defluxus coeli,</hi> a divine breath inſpired from heaven, but either <hi>exhalatio terrae,</hi> a terrene exhalation drawn from the hollows of a corrupt heart; or blaſt from the ſpirituall powers of the air, a ſuggeſtion of Satan.</p>
